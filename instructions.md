### Template Literal Homework

--------------------------------------------------------------
In this assignment, you will be creating an object called "me"

This object will store 5 different properties

-name ***String
-gender ***String
-age ***Number
-favorite color ***String
-happy ***Boolean

me = {
    name: "Jonathan",
    gender: "male",
    age: 21,
    favoriteColor: "green",
    happy: true
}

Using template literals, you will have the console log:
"Hello, my name is <name>, I am <age> years old.  I am a <gender>, and my favorite color is <favoriteColor>,
if someone asked if I am happy, I would say <happy>"
